## Installation

1. Install dependencies.

  - **OSX/Windows** You will probably want to install
    [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads#_macosx),
    a Python package manager. ***IMPORTANT:* Install the Python 3.X version.**
  
  - **Linux** You will need Python 3, and the python3 packages `numpy`,
    `matplotlib`, and `pillow`, installed through your package manager or `pip`.

2. Clone this repository.
  
  1. Open the terminal, and run `git clone git@github.com:wackywendell/diffusiontrap.git`

That's all, there's no setup for a pure-python program like this.

## Running

1. Export your data.

  - First, you will need to export your data to `tif` format, so that it alternates
yellow and cyan frames, with cyan first.

2. Open a terminal in the right directory.

  - Open the Terminal application.
  
  - Type in `cd /Users/your_username/directory_images_are_in`
